The kiss launcher is a free and open source home launcher for andriod

it's a minimal launcher which revolves around it's search and history feature, which forces you to be descriptive with what you want.

You spend less time just scrolling through your phone trying to find something interesting (though that can still happen) and more time actively using your phone to do something you need it to do.

It's favourites feature make sure that the important things are always at your fingertips like your traditional launcher, it's history molds your apps to you, and it's search makes sure you have the power to affect your device however you want

I cannot understate the power of search

- apps
- app subservices
- search
- math equations
- making calls

the list goes on

Now that I'm finished with the good, let's go to the bad

widgets and space

widgets only work in minimal mode

the ever changing history makes forming strong physical memory impossible

both are fixable, but not seamlessly
